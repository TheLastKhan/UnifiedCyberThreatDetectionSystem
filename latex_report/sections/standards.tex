    \item Security of processing: Encryption and access controls
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ISO/IEC 29100 -- Privacy Framework:} Privacy principles implementation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consent and choice in data collection
    \item Purpose legitimacy and specification
    \item Collection limitation
    \item Data minimization

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Machine Learning and AI Standards}

\textbf{ISO/IEC 22989 -- Artificial Intelligence Concepts and Terminology:} Standard AI terminology is used throughout documentation and implementation.

\textbf{IEEE 7000 -- Model Process for Addressing Ethical Concerns:} Ethical considerations in AI development:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transparency and explainability requirements
    \item Bias detection and mitigation
    \item Human oversight mechanisms
    \item Accountability for AI decisions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ISO/IEC 23894 -- Risk Management for AI:} AI-specific risk management:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Training data quality assurance
    \item Model validation and testing
    \item Monitoring of model performance drift
    \item Security against adversarial attacks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Web Development Standards}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project):} Security best practices following OWASP Top 10:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Injection prevention (SQL, XSS)
    \item Broken authentication prevention
    \item Sensitive data exposure protection
    \item Security misconfiguration prevention
    \item Input validation and sanitization
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logging and Monitoring Standards}

\textbf{RFC 5424 -- Syslog Protocol:} Standardized logging format for system events and alerts.

\textbf{Common Event Format (CEF):} Standardized format for security event logging to enable interoperability with SIEM systems.
